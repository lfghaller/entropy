This is a package to my research code. I'm currently working on data compression and entropy, and how they
affect our understanding. My hypothesis is that the grammar rules are transfered to binary data and that a well
written text has high entropy and cannot be compressed very much.1
 Add a line note

The method is quite simple.
1) Get a plain text of your information.
2) Get a zip program and simply zip it!
3)If the file does not compress well, the text is well written. Otherwise, if the compression is more than a half, your text is possibly a waste of time.
